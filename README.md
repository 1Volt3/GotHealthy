This app will initially be implemented and designed for iOS devices only. Future development will include the addition of Android devices. 

Running this app requires a computer running Mac OS (Operating system). 
To run the demo of this project, Xcode is required as a free download from the app store. 
The code for the demo can be achieved through a clone or download of the project from GitHub.
From there in Xcode, to demo the project, a user will be required to select an iOS device from the simulator choices or will need an actual device connected to their computer. 

Main users of the app have the ability to directly download the app from the app store on their iOS device.

The app is designed to track a users physical activty through the use of the accelerometer. This will allow the app to show a user the precise amount of calories they have lost through exercise.
